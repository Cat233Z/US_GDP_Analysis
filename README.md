# US_GDP_Analysis
Final course project for R data analysis class

This project analyzes how population size, total GDP, and unemployment rate vary across U.S. states. 
I explored the relationships between these variables using three cleaned datasets scraped from Wikipedia.

The main conclusions are that states with larger populations tend to have higher total GDP, but GDP per capita varies widely. 
Also, unemployment rates show some variation with GDP levels.

## Code Style Guide
I followed the Tidyverse Style Guide (https://style.tidyverse.org/) for my R code.
